### Requirements

- **System packages**: See `preres.sh` for the installation of system dependencies.
- **Conda packages**: Installed by `install_conda.sh`, including `gitpython`, `pyyaml`, `flask`, `opencv`, and `requests`.
- **FFmpeg**: Used for video streaming, installed as part of system requirements.
- **Streaming Devices**: Details on configured devices are in `used_devices.txt`.

---

### Installation

#### 1. Preliminary Setup

Run `preres.sh` to install system dependencies and prepare the environment.

```bash
bash preres.sh
```

#### 2. Install Anaconda

Run `install_conda.sh` to set up the `bugfinder` environment with necessary Python packages.

```bash
bash install_conda.sh
```

#### 3. Install Nginx with RTMP Module

Install and configure Nginx with RTMP support using `Nginx_install.py`.

```bash
python3 Nginx_install.py
```

#### 4. Configure Nginx

Configuration files for Nginx, including `nginx.conf` and `nginx_vars.yml`, set up paths and RTMP module options. Use `nginx-rtmp.service` to manage Nginx as a systemd service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx-rtmp.service
sudo systemctl start nginx-rtmp.service
```

---

### Usage

- **Web Interface**: Access live streams via the `index.html` page.
- **Service Management**: Use `streams.service` and `nginx-rtmp.service` to manage streams and Nginx server.
- **Streaming**: Start streaming manually with `start_streams.sh` or through `ffmpeg-cmd.sh` for single-camera configurations.
